# Laravel improved env file

This repository provides an improved version of the default .env.example file that comes with Laravel. The main goal is to improve the standard .env file by sorting into alphabetical blocks, making it easier to find and manage them.

The file is fully compatible with Laravel 5.x, 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x, and can be used as a drop-in replacement for the default .env.example file, and new Laravel installs env.

If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
